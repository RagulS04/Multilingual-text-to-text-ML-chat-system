Problem Statement: 
In an increasingly interconnected world, effective communication across language barriers is crucial. Machine translation systems have made significant advancements in recent years, but there remain challenges in developing real-time, multi-lingual translation systems for chat applications. The goal is to create a seamless experience where users can converse fluently in their preferred language without the need for manual translation.

Abstract:
Now-a-days, Chat has become increasingly important as an effective means to communicate in social networks. However, the current generation of personal chat systems only offer monolingual chat services; external translation must be facilitated by additional third-party programmes. In order to get around this problem and simplify translation without the need for third-party apps, this chat system integrates with a machine translation system that allows users to translate text into the languages of their choice. The proposed system eliminates the need to have a common language for chat communication. In this chat system the user texts in their own language. The text is translated to the language opted by the end user and the system synthesizes it. Here, we discuss an interface prototype that can overcome the language barrier to some extent by developing a multi-lingual text-to-text machine translation chat application. This system is based on Neural Machine Translation which automatically translates a sentence(chat) from one language to another. This benefits multilingual individuals by facilitating real-time translation, enabling seamless communication across diverse linguistic backgrounds, industries, and personal interactions.




Objectives:
To enable trouble-free communication without linguistic barriers.
To facilitate seamless communication between users speaking different languages.
To provide users with the ability to send and receive messages in their preferred language.
To offer real-time translation services to bridge language barriers during conversations using neural machine translation.
To support multiple languages and language preferences to cater to diverse user needs.
To ensure user privacy and security while handling sensitive communication data.
To create a user-friendly interface that promotes easy navigation and efficient communication.
To enable users to view both the original message and its translated version for context.

Tools:
Frontend : ReactJS, TailwindCSS
Backend : NodeJS, Express Framework, Socket I/O, FireBase, Neural Machine Translation with Hugging face(Python).
